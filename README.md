# Psiphon4
A simple batch file that uses the mechanic that uses the vpn connection to update and download the newest version and then keep the old file to keep using this old file. Using the old version before Speed Passes and limits were added (idk if this is the perfect version but it is one of the newest without speed boosts)

## Installation Steps:
- 1. Download the `psiphon4.bat` file
- 2. Move it to a non-admin writable folder that doesn't have other files in it (for best operation)
- 3. Use it
  - A. Run the Batch file
  - B. Accessibility
    - 1. (Easier) Create a shortcut using `cmd.exe /C path_to_file.bat`
    - 2. Pin to taskbar or start by moving the shortcut to `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs`
